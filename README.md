# Movie Seat Booking

Welcome to Movie Seat Booking! This project allows users to select and book seats for a movie screening. It is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any dependencies on Bootstrap or external APIs. Please note that this project requires a live server to run correctly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd Movie-Seat-Booking
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   Since this project relies on client-side JavaScript and requires a live server, you can use any local server setup to view the project. One common approach is to use the `live-server` npm package. If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it globally using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g live-server
   ```
   Then, simply navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   live-server
   ```
   This will start a live server and open the project in your default web browser.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can:

- **View Available Seats**: See the layout of the movie theater and available seats.
- **Select Seats**: Click on the seats you want to book.
- **View Total Price**: The total price updates as you select seats.
- **Book Seats**: Click the "Book Now" button to confirm your seat selection and complete the booking.
